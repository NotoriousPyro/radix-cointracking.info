A collection of scripts for transforming CSVs for the purpose of importing XRD trades and the like into CoinTracking.info for mostly tax reporting purposes.

Currently only supports radixportfolio.info, and may not ever support anything else unless I or someone else decides to write any others...

I use this tracking rewards with XRD, using radixportfolio.info and transforming the **Income Report** to a format that can be understood by CoinTracking.info's Custom Exchange Importer (csv) tool.

The scripts in here will probably all be written in Python (3.10+), because it's nice and easy to use and write for simple things like this.
